This video is a 6-minute CGI movie showcasing the "Lavaforming" project for the Venice Biennale 2025 exhibition. The film visualizes speculative architectural interventions that respond to volcanic activity on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula.

When analyzing scenes, please focus on:
- The relationship between lava flows and architectural structures
- How the built environment responds to and coexists with volcanic processes
- The aesthetic qualities of lava as a natural building material
- Transitions between natural landscapes and designed interventions
- The use of color, texture, and movement to represent the dynamic nature of volcanic landscapes
- Any symbolic or metaphorical content relating to human adaptation to natural forces

The video is intended for a public exhibition audience, not technical experts, so emphasize visually striking elements and conceptual relationships rather than technical details. Descriptions should be accessible and evocative, helping viewers understand the creative vision of using volcanic forces as a design parameter in architecture.
